  # Directory (relative to the root of your repo) that contains the deploy-ready assets.
  # For Next.js, this is typically .next

# These settings are used by `netlify dev`
[dev]
  command = "next dev" # Command to start your development server
  port = 3000          # Port that the development server will run on

# For most Next.js projects, Netlify's Essential Next.js Build Plugin
# is automatically installed and configured. You usually don't need to add it manually.
# If you need specific plugin configurations, you can add them like this:
# [[plugins]]
#   package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
  # Optional inputs for the plugin can go here
